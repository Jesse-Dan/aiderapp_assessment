- the first is as described: withing 3 days i installed lando while updating the blogs urls button and other links, which i did well and there was no return; except when the client requested i use NEWS and not publications. @Joshua asked me to use publications for the tagged content.

In the case studies sent to me here it wasn't clear what to do with (X) twitter links so i went ahead and removed all the authors as instructed as fast as possible (and it was never returned for the work i did). when it was returned i was asked to also remove the (X) twitter links which i then did. 
- the third is as described: then came a new task run and install surrey care. Which i did sucessfully launched. i don't understand how this could be returned.
- the forth is as described: At this point i had completed FBHSD-543, i moved forward to FBHSD-543 which was to edit the date of all resources on IES, i did this for 2 days up to 400+ resorces worked on which was almost half (sorry to mention, but this same task took 3 days when resigned), and i managed to complete the (X) twitter link removal at this time while FBHSD-543 was reasigned.
- the fifth is as described:
